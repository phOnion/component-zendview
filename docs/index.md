# Getting Started

A component providing `zendframework/zend-view` as template
renderer in onion applications. The module comes pre-configured
and should work instantly, but some configuration options might
need to be tweaked by you, therefore you should check the
[documentation available here](https://zendframework.github.io/zend-view/quick-start/#configuration) to see the available options.

(_Disclaimer: This is the official module, `zendframework/zend-expressive-zendview-renderer` with some
additional packages `navigation` and `paginator` being such, and some other ones as well, probably in the future_)

While majority of the keys stay the same as those in the official documentation,
some are different, see *Configuration* section for a list of known diffs.
